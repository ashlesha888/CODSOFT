# CodSoft C++ Internship Tasks

This repository contains the 4 C++ tasks I completed during my online internship at CodSoft. Each task demonstrates core C++ programming concepts through simple and interactive console-based projects.

## Task 1: Number Guessing Game  
A console game where the program generates a random number, and the user keeps guessing until it's correct. The program gives hints (too high/low) and tracks the number of attempts.

## Task 2: Basic Calculator  
A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.
